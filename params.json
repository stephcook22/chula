Checkout this repo\r\n2. Composer install\r\n3. Add content/draft and content/pages folders in the project root\r\n4. You're done!\r\n\r\n##Templating\r\nA very basic example of a template set has been included. To make your own template simply copy this folder\r\nand give it a new name.\r\nChange the 'theme' config variable to your new folder name and Chula should then run off your theme.\r\n\r\nFor the moment there aren't a huge amount of twig variables available to you. If you find you need more please let us\r\nknow so we can add them to the main build.\r\n\r\nTo render the page content you MUST use `{{ content | raw}}`\r\n\r\n###Global variables\r\nThe following are twig variables which are always accessible in any of your templates\r\n  * `admin_path` - path to the admin kit\r\n  * `app.request.getBaseURL()` - base url to the app\r\n\r\n\r\n###Template Pages\r\nThe page templates currently called are:\r\n  * home.twig\r\n  * page.twig\r\n  * 404.twig\r\n  * error.twig\r\n\r\nThey must be named as shown above.\r\n\r\n####home.twig\r\nYou are passed an array of pages.\r\nEach page in this array has a slug, date and content.\r\nTo render the page content you MUST use `{{ content | raw}}`\r\n\r\n####page.twig\r\nYou are currently passed the content to this page.\r\nYou are now also passed the `{{date}}` and the `{{slug}}`\r\nTo render the page content you MUST use `{{ content | raw}}`\r\n\r\nYou can format the date with the date filter in twig eg `{{page.date|date}}`\r\nYou also have access to the truncate filter eg `{{ page.content|truncate(150)|raw }}`\r\n\r\n####error.twig and 404.twig\r\nThese are called if an error or specifically a 404 error occurs.\r\nYou are passed in the `{{message}}` which you can display if you like.\r\n\r\n##Tests\r\nTests have been setup in the tests/ directory using Codeception.\r\n###Coverage\r\nwget https://raw.github.com/Codeception/c3/master/c3.php\r\n\r\nvendor/codeception/codeception/codecept run --coverage --xml --html\r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
